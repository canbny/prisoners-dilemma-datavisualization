# Prisoner's Dilemma Data Visualization

This repository presents data visualizations of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, developed for the **YİST303 – Data Visualization (Veri Görselleştirme)** course by *Can Binay*.

This repository includes the final project prepared for the YİST303 – Data Visualization course, offered in 2025 by the **Department of Statistics at Eskişehir Technical University** under the instruction of *Assoc. Prof. Mustafa Çavuş*.

*Course Repository : [Course_DataVisualization](https://github.com/mcavs/Course_DataVisualization)*

**Note :** I used dilemma.csv in R (data taken from [Axelrod's Effective Choice in the Prisoner's Dilemma](https://www.jstor.org/stable/173932?seq=1) article). I used the [Axelrod Python library](https://axelrod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for the remaining plots.
